# XMLHelper

XMLHelper is a small utility tool. It facilitates the user to extract Text from XML Node(s), and conversely to create XML String from provided Text values.

If you have an XML Strings file, and need to get text from each of the xml string. It might takes a lot of time to copy single text from each of the xml node.
Therefore, XMLHelper, is the right solution for you. Just paste xml string consisting of many xml nodes in the left textbox, and press the Extract Text... button. 
This way you'll get Text from each of the xml node, in the same order. 
Conversely, if you have a list of texts and you want to create an XML string, paste this list on the Right textbox and press Create XML String... button. 
In the same textbox, you'll get the generated XML String. By default, first node will be <root> and every other text has <node> tag.
